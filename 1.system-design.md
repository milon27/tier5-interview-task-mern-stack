## q.1. How can you manage 10M+ users data in your DB? Please create a sample DB with dummy data. Along with that please write your system design approach.

> 10M is huge amount, so we need to scale our system. we are going to follow few steps to acieve scalibility.
1. Database
    - we will use relational db
    - for scale the database we will use AWS RDBMS or Some other DB service (Digital Ocean db service) to reduce the work.
2. Server 
    - we will use Node JS, Express JS for our web server to build the REST API.
    - we will use Redis to caching API response which are not changed so frequently.
    - we will use multiple server to host the applicaton (horizontal scaling) and then use NGINX to load banalce to them.
